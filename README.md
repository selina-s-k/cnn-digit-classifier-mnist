# CNN Digit Classifier (MNIST Dataset)
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in PyTorch to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. It includes full training, validation, and test pipeline support.

## Project Overview
- Input: 28x28 grayscale images from the MNIST dataset (`train.csv`, `test.csv`)
- Model: Two convolutional layers, max pooling, fully connected layers with dropout
- Output: Trained model and submission file for Kaggle
